You're a developer. You have work in your office, a tendency to be updated via Twitter/Hacker News, an affinity towards books and sometimes, staying fit. You have a big list of hobby projects to be carried, you need time to learn new stuff and do awesome things. You also have a time-management problem arising with all these. So what will you do to balance things out?

Simple. Move awesomeness to the weekends - your projects and learning things. Keep reading and news active during weekdays. You won't have the mood to work on these anyway. Plus, news are dull on weekends. 

Weekends are the best time for things you love - 3 nights and 2 days of pure time. Be it coding, learning or er.. movies with a drink.

Finally realized.
