    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;re a developer. You have work in your office, a tendency to be updated via Twitter/Hacker News, an affinity towards books and sometimes, staying fit. You have a big list of hobby projects to be carried, you need time to learn new stuff and do awesome things. You also have a time-management problem arising with all these. So what will you do to balance things out?</p>

<p>Simple. Move awesomeness to the weekends &ndash; your projects and learning things. Keep reading and news active during weekdays. You won&rsquo;t have the mood to work on these anyway. Plus, news are dull on weekends.</p>

<p>Weekends are the best time for things you love &ndash; 3 nights and 2 days of pure time. Be it coding, learning or er.. movies with a drink.</p>

<p>Finally realized.</p>
